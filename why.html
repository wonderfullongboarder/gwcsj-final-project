  <h1>Why</h1>
  <h3>Why did you make this website?</h3>
  My first reaseon is obvious. For GWC. Second reason? Well, this is just something I did for fun. Also, it's kinda a portfolio of a type.
  <h3>Why is this website so basic?</h3>
  This website is so basic because I had technical issues, and had to finish all of this in 3 days. Yes, that may sound like a lot of time
  but keep in mind that I have homework, extra-curriculum activities, and other thing that I have to do. Also, this is all that I remembered 
  from the lessons, because I couldn't ask the instructor or any officers for help.
