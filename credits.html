  <h1>Credits</h1>
Many people have helped me make this website, and I would like to appreciate them. First off, I would like to thank our instructor, Andrew.
He has taught us all of the basics of html, css, and java script. Secondly, would be my mom and sister for sticking with me when I was going
to give up. Also, the club officers, and Mrs. Reed for providing us with the facilities and refreshments. Lastly, everyone who has helped 
me, even to the slightest degree. Thank you!!
